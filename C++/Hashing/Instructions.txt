The objectives of this particular assignment are:

1. To appreciate the concept of hashing
2. To develop your own hashing functions (three functions)
3. To compare the relative performance of the hashing functions you developed based on the number
of collisions

Your task is to develop three different hashing functions using the following:

1. Prime Division Remainder Method (or Division Method)
2. Digit Extraction Method
3. Folding Method
to hash the keywords & reserved of the C programming language and Java Programming language. The
above hashing methods maybe combined, for example, digit extraction with prime division remainder
method. You should produce a hash function that will give only few collisions.

Requirements:

1. You are required to use C programming language to fulfil this assignment.
2. Your objective is to run your program (with your hash functions defined) and take note of the number of
collisions. In addition, you are to document clearly of your observation and analysis of the entire
experiments. The “evolution” of your hash functions until the final version (that yield fewer collisions)
must be documented and discussed thoroughly. A table-form presentation can be used for this purpose.
See an example below. Also, any assumptions you have defined must be clearly documented as well (i.e.,
making different “keys” of equal length).
At the end of each hash function (final version), you are to discuss its advantages and disadvantages (or
strengths and weaknesses).
